      <p>
        I'm Justus Wamswa Chemirmir from Nairobi, Kenya. <br><br>

        I completed my secondary education at Lenana School before joining African Leadership College, Mauritius,
        where I'm pursuing BSc(Hons) Computing. I love programming, network technology and cyber security. <br><br>
        In line with my major, my mission is to provide job opportunities for the youth
        through technology. I also enjoy playing football and photography.

      <h5 class="card-title  ">WHY ALU?</h5>

      <p>
        African Leadership University was brought to my attention back in high School
        by my senior friends who had interacted with the African Leadership Academy, where
        some ended up. It was, then, a new institution therefore I did not think
        through it much when considering options for tertiary education. <br><br>
        Upon completion of my secondary studies, I was ready to pursue a lifelong dream of studying abroad. After
        discussions with
        my mentors and deliberate consideration of a plethora of institutions across the globe, ALU ended
        up as one of my options.
        The school's learning model where students are involved in every facet of there studies was
        the clincher that made me settle for the school. I wanted to own every step of my university experience
        and what better school than ALU. The institution also offers UK accredited degrees through their
        partnership
        with Glasgow Caledonian Univerty, Scotland.

      <h5 class="card-title  ">Application and Acceptance</h5>
      <p>
        The application process was not the most linear as online research alone was not that efficient due to the
        novelty
        of the institution. I interacted with students and admissions officers who gave insightful comments and
        were
        willing to respond to queries swiftly. Ironically, I ended up submitting my application at the last
        minute. Let's say I was
        paying close attention to details. I didn't want to miss this opportunity. <br> <br>

        <image src="../IMAGES/justus/IMG20210806175018.jpg" style="width: 100%;"/> <br><br>

        I had to be the happiest at the moment I received my acceptance. It
        was a dream come true. I celebrated this success with my family and friends in numerous befitting ways.
        I took a gap year to explore different fields and focus more on my career journey. <br><br>
        During that period the COVID-19 pandemic blew out and brought most operations worldwide to a standstill.
        It was a period of uncertainty considering I was suppossed to begin my studies that fall but health
        precedes everything else. After negotiations with the Ministry of Health, the school managed to fly us to
        Mauritius at the start of January 2021. At last some good news was coming our way. We underwent all
        the necessary health protocols including a two-week mandatory quarantine to curb the spread of the virus.
        The discussions we had as students when we met at the airport were continued on phone calls in hotel
        rooms.
        The hospitality we received during that tough period was top-notch. <br><br>

      <h5 class="card-title">Mauritius</h5>
      <div class="mauritius"></div>
      <p>
        We were warmly received by staff and students on our arrival to campus. The atmosphere was vibrant, and
        services
        and facilities were exquisite. The classes are very interactive with the students at the center of
        discussions
        through our able facilitators. Most classes end on Thursday and a session lasts for 1 hour 30 min. The number 
        of classes per day are different depending on your course of study but there are usually 2 classes per day on average.

        I have engaged in numerous on and off campus activities. I'm a Member of <strong>Karma FC</strong> which is the school's 
        football club. I've also participated in Hult Prize Competition to pitch our enterpreneurial venture. The school is always 
        abuzz with activities. <br><br>

        Mauritius being a tropical island, it is humid and warm almost throughout the year. The island hosts vast plantations of 
        sugarcane which is the main cash crop. There are a lot of natural phenomena to witness, places to visit and activities to do: 
        white sandy beaches, waterfalls, national parks, museums, water parks, aquariums, hikes, etc. I also got to experience two cyclones; 
        it is scary and catastrophic but following the government's laid procedures almost assures you safety. The country's security 
        is high, healthcare is free in public hospitals, and the people are friendly. <br><br>

      <h5 class="card-title  ">Social Life</h5>

      <p>
        As noted earlier, there is always something to do outside schoolwork. From activities organised by the school 
        to those arranged by the student themselves. These can be sports, resident games, cultural activities, diversity and 
        inclusion programmes, visitors from outside and many more. The activities can be done from within or outside school 
        boundaries. The staff are also much engaged where needed. <br><br>

      <div class="careers"></div>

      <p>
        There is a Career Development Department that helps students to navigate there career paths and choices 
        while in ALU and beyond. You will get enough guidance and coaching to help you kick-start your career journey. 
        There is also an Entrepreneurship Department that promotes innovation through partial funding of student-led startups 
        and organises competitions from time to time. 
        Lastly, students have also taken it upon themselves to create clubs and societies that help them hone their skills. I 
        have personally used these gateways to help me further my knowledge and skills in the world of employment and entrepreneurship.
