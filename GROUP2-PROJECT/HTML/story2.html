              <h5 class="card-title py-3">Before ALU</h5>
              <p class="mt-2">
                Before joining African Leadership University, I had already obtained a National Diploma certificate in 
                computer science at one of the state polytechnics in Nigeria. <br>
                Because of my passion for mentoring and Bsc holders are usually considered for teaching positions, 
                especially recent graduates in education, I decided to further my education. 
                After I graduated from the polytechnic, I worked for more than fourteen months so I can save and continue my education. 
                Then, I applied for a Bsc in computer science at one of the state universities in Nigeria and I was given admission. 
                A few weeks later, I resumed and was excited to properly begin the journey of my passion despite not having enough funds to sponsor my education. <br />
              </p>
              <h5 class="card-title py-3">ALU Journey</h5>
              <p>
                It was during the first month of my resumption at the university that my guardian sent me the ALU scholarship application link. On seeing the application link, 
                I went online to know more about the school as well as the scholarship. <br>
                It was then I discovered the mission of ALU which is to “Transform Africa by developing its future leaders who will have a deep 
                understanding of the challenges and opportunities on the continent”. <br>
                <br>
                On discovering that the mission of ALU is what I needed to pursue my passion. 
                I quickly jumped to the available course, of which my dream course “computing” was listed. <br>
                 At the sight of seeing this, I started the application process without delay. <br>
                <br>
                The application process was not complex as the instructions were easy to understand and navigate.
                 A few weeks after submission, I was admitted into the university and before I could complete the celebration, 
                a congratulation scholarship email was sent. It was indeed a breath of fresh.
              </p>
              <h5 class="card-title py-3">Life At ALU</h5>
              <p>
                The plan and preparation to study outside the country for the first time was the greatest memory of my life. Although we(ALU newly admitted students) were supposed to resume school in September 2020, we couldn't because of covid-19 restrictions. 
                Thus, we went there in January 2021. However, ALU organized an online course for prospective students for four months which was from September to December. <br>
                When we finally traveled in January 2021 to Mauritius,  we were isolated for two weeks in a hotel. At the end of it, the hotel management organized a breakfast get-together for all the students that were quarantined. 
                It was there I had the opportunity to meet and interact with other students. We went from the hotel to campus where we were welcomed warmly. <br>
                The school organized an orientation ceremony for us for a few days and it was awesome. <br>
                After the orientation, I resumed lectures. <br>
                <br>
                Also, ALU devotes its first year to what it calls the “Leadership core”. Through its courses in Data and Decisions, Projects, Entrepreneurial Leadership, and Communicating for Impact, Leadership Core" 
                Seeks to create a high-quality learning experience for students that enables them to build real-world skills and prepare for Global Challenges." Hence, my passion was redefined after being exposed to leadership core. <br>
                Furthermore, believing that things will turn out for the best is one of the keys to success, Stopping and losing hope can be a barrier. Hence, faith doesn’t require a reason or proof, it only requires determination. 
                For this reason, I trusted the process of getting to ALU. Therefore, I will advise prospective students to give their best in all they do and believe that it will all end well.
              </p>

              <!-- <a href="#" class="btn btn-outline-warning"></a> -->
              <p>
                Additionally, my time at ALU thus far has been amazing, as I am not only better academically but also doing great in terms of entrepreneurship.
                 I was able to establish a hair saloon on campus that helps students to make their hair at affordable prices. 
                I also hope to expand as I continue my academic and entrepreneurship journey.

              <p>
                I have come to realize how important it is to keep a social life. Hence, Music and African cultural dance have been a way of expressing myself over the years. <br>
                This is because having a social life substantially enhances our everyday activities. Therefore, participating in music and African cultural dance has made life 
                more exciting and enabled me to live outside of the normal routine and boredom.

              <h5 class="card-title py-3">Ideas For the Future & Careers</h5>
              <p>
                My idea for the future is to explore my mission. Thus, my mission is to use my voices, leadership, influence, and teamwork to make progress for “Girl Child Education awareness” around the world, especially in Africa.
                 This will be done by setting goals and objectives as well as maintaining a sense of realism while challenging myself in the future.  Also, I will make sure my goals are measurable, have deadlines, and that they are particular to my mission's goals.
                <br>
                <br>
                Aside from the plans I have for my future goals, my career is an important aspect that has its own plans too. Therefore, the idea of my career in lecturing includes; pursuing an area of expertise, earning a postgraduate degree, gain relevant experience, 
                and seeking out an adjunct position as a lecturer. After I have succeeded, I will continue my academic journey by writing for academic publications, and secure a tenured position. As well as publishing my own books. <br>
                <br>
                Additionally, I will expand my hair salon business to a full beauty company where everything of beauty can be gotten from.

              <p>
                I was born and raised in Edo State, Nigeria, where I developed a strong interest in learning more about the challenges that hinder the education of girls and how to mitigate them. <br>
                This is because growing up as the first child in a family of six children was a bit tough in terms of acquiring education, especially as a girl child. <br>
                Hence, these challenges led to the passion for building a better and healthier Africa. <br>
                Despite being Africa's largest economy, gender equality in education has been a major in some parts, especially the rural area. 
                Hence, education opportunities are mostly limited for girls. However, this barrier did not stop me from getting the basic education I needed to get to the top.

              <p>
                Nigeria is my home country and a beautiful place to be. More also, Nigeria is made up of 36 states and several ethnic groups. Within these ethnic groups are several tribes of a total of 371.  Thus, I am from Edo state, one of the most beautiful states in Nigeria. As the center and cradle of culture in Nigeria,
                Edo state is the custodian of significant historical artifacts made of bronze, brass, timber, and terracotta. Additionally, the Edo state also known as the Edo Kingdom of Benin is one of the most well-known precolonial kingdoms on the Guinea Coast of West Africa. 
                Hence, I speak Edo and English languages because English is the official language of Nigeria and I am an Edo by the tribe. <br>

              <p>
                Mauritius is a beautiful island country that is famous for its natural riches and great culture. However, I do not admire the taste and smell of their food because I am already used to typical Nigerian dishes so it was very difficult to cope. 
                Because of the struggle I had with eating and studies, I reached out to the student life and wellness team. It was them that gave me the strategies to manage my academics and prepare my own meal with the available foodstuff in the country. <br>

              It was through the management style, I discovered that I had extra time to venture into entrepreneurship. Then I used the opportunity to start my own establishment on campus, called Jossy Nation Hair Touch.

            <p>
              Although I like traveling and exploring new places, I hardly ever see the time to do such because of my busy schedule. Hence, I use my free time to search for new hairstyles and update my saloon skills.
